# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Control Center v2 — Retail/Wholesale Section Independence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One clarification was raised and resolved inline during specification (see "Clarifications" section in spec.md): the reported T014 product-form gap was found already resolved during verification, so the spec reframes it as a verification/completion step (FR-017) folded into User Story 2 rather than a from-scratch build item.
- All items pass. Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
